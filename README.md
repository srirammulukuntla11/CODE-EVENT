🎹 Code Event
**Code Event** is a simple and interactive web application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It listens for key presses and displays useful information about the key in real time:
- **event.key** → The actual key pressed (e.g., `A`, `Enter`, `Space`)  
- **event.keyCode** → The numeric code of the key (deprecated, but shown for learning)  
- **event.code** → The physical key on the keyboard (e.g., `KeyA`, `ArrowLeft`)
  
🚀 Features
- Detects **any key press instantly**  
- Displays key details in a clean UI  
- Built with **HTML** (structure), **CSS** (styling), and **JavaScript** (logic)  
- Beginner-friendly project to learn JavaScript keyboard events
